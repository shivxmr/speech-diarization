SPEAKER 1 0:00:01
Can I ask you a question? 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:03
Of course you can. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:05
Can you get me out of this place? 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:07
I'm afraid I'm of no use to you there. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:10
Why couldn't they put me in a proper prison? 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:11
A better facility wasn't available. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:13
Or put me in a madhouse. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:14
It's a secure training centre. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:16
Training? What are they training us for? The other boys just scream all the time. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:21
I thought this had been explained to you, Jamie. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:21
And they rock backwards and forwards and they shower at current agencies. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:23
Young offenders institutions have got 15 up. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:26
One kid goes nuts every time you see Steve McDonald. It's a maddening day, you don't understand. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:29
This was the best place for you to be. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:31
Ryan gets to stay at home until his trial. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:33
Ryan isn't accused of such a serious crime. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:35
Accused? It's all accused. If I did it, if I hurt her, then I get it. But I didn't, so... 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:40
I understand it, Jamie, and this wasn't my decision. This was the best place for you to be. Nothing has been decided yet. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:46
You know where it's going to be? London or some local? 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:48
You need to sit down, Jamie. If you don't sit down... 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:51
Does that mean you don't know what you just want to tell me? 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:54
Nothing's been decided yet. You need to sit down. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:56
I don't want to sit down. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:57
If you don't sit down, I have to stop this discussion. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:59
Maybe I want to sit down. I don't want you to. Do you? It'd piss you off, that, wouldn't it? You'd have to go home and then come back again. 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:04
Jamie, if you do not sit... 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:06
I don't fucking want to sit down! You do not tell me when to sit down! You do not control what I fucking... Look at me now! You do not control what I do in my life! Get that in that fucking little head of yours! Fucking hell!
