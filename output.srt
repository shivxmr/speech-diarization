[SPEAKER 2] No, I don't. Sorry.

3
0,00,140 --> 0,00,339
[SPEAKER 1] Oh. My car's broken down and I wondered if you could tell me where to find a garage.

4
0,00,260 --> 0,00,500
[SPEAKER 2] Well, you know, that's wasted on me. I don't understand what you're saying.

5
0,00,740 --> 0,00,059
[SPEAKER 1] You don't speak any English at all?

6
0,00,160 --> 0,00,799
[SPEAKER 2] Not a word, no. It's one of those things where I wish I paid more attention in school. But, um... Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry. Do you speak any English? English? No. What's the problem? I don't know. I can't understand it.

0,00,299 --> 0,00,780
[SPEAKER 2] Tell you what, if you go down that way, about half a mile, there's a village. There might be somebody there that speaks English.
